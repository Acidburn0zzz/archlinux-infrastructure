"""This module contains your site-specific settings.

From a brand new distribution it should be copied to mm_cfg.py.  If you
already have an mm_cfg.py, be careful to add in only the new settings you
want.  Mailman's installation procedure will never overwrite your mm_cfg.py
file.

The complete set of distributed defaults, with documentation, are in the file
Defaults.py.  In mm_cfg.py, override only those you want to change, after the

  from Defaults import *

line (see below).

Note that these are just default settings; many can be overridden via the
administrator and user interfaces on a per-list or per-user basis.

Also note that many of these settings will not be effective until Mailman
is restarted.  Thus, you should always restart Mailman after changing this
file.

Further, settings which relate to a list's host_name and web_page_url only
affect lists created after the change.  For existing lists, see the FAQ at
<http://wiki.list.org/x/mIA9>.
