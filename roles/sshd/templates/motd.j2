[1;32mUsage Info[0m
  - Use the [1mdevtools[0m helpers to build packages.
  - Don't forget to set your [1mPACKAGER[0m in [1;34m~/.makepkg.conf[0m.
  - [1mChroots[0m are kept in [1;34m/var/lib/archbuild[0m (~chroots).
  - [1mSRCDEST[0m is set to [1;34m/var/lib/archbuilddest/srcdest[0m (~srcdest).
  - Take a look at [1mmkpkg -hh[0m if you want to build nightlies.

  Package diff tools:
    [1mdiffrepo[0m    : Lightweight alternative to checkpkg. Only diffs filenames.
    [1mpkgdiffrepo[0m : Heavyweight alternative to checkpkg. Uses pkgdiff.

[1;32mSeptember 25, 2016[0m
  Pkgbuild.com was moved to a [1mnew server[0m (again)! This one uses spinning rust
  so we have plenty of space. Chroots are on a tmpfs to keep things fast.

[1;32mOctober 11, 2016[0m
  Added [1mgitpkg[0m, an experimental script written to maintain GNOME git packages.
  May also fit other packages.
