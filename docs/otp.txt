# Set up OTP for access to Hetzner's control panel

You can use smartphone 2fa apps like Google Authenticator or pass-otp.

## pass-otp

Install with `pacman -S pass-otp` and run `pass otp insert -i Hetzner -a
archlinux-master-token Hetzner/archlinux-master-token -s`. You will be asked
to supply the "secret" which you can find in "misc/hetzner-password.vault" with
the name "hetzner_master_seed". Once done, run `pass otp code
Hetzner/archlinux-master-token` to generate an OTP you can use to log in.

Go to the 2fa management page: https://accounts.hetzner.com/tfa

Add a new authentication method with your username and add the token of this
key to pass as well by running something similar to `pass otp insert -i
Hetzner -a archlinux Hetzner/archlinux -s`.
