# Set up OTP for access to Hetzner's control panel

You can use smartphone 2fa apps like Google Authenticator or pass-otp.

## Logging in via pass-otp

Install with `pacman -S pass-otp` and run `pass otp insert -i Hetzner -a
archlinux-master-token Hetzner/archlinux-master-token -s`. You will be asked
to supply the "secret" which you can find in "misc/vault_hetzner.yml" with
the name "hetzner_master_seed". Once done, run `pass otp code
Hetzner/archlinux-master-token` to generate an OTP you can use to log in.

## Adding your own account

Go to the 2fa management page: https://accounts.hetzner.com/tfa

Add a new authentication method with your username and add the token of this
key to either pass or an OTP tool of your choice.

Make sure to put your nickname into the description so we know who that key belongs to.

If you choose to use pass, you can add the key by running something
similar to `pass otp insert -i Hetzner -a archlinux Hetzner/archlinux -s`.

If you want to use your own tool, you can either scan the QR code or enter the shown string manually.
