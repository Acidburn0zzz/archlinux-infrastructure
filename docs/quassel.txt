# Quassel

We offer a Quassel instance for Arch team members who can not easily run their own bouncer.

## Freenode restrictions

Freenode restricts or limits multiple connections from the same IP Address.
Every quassel user users a separate connection so we currently have an
excemption for 20 connections. If we want to raise this limit we have to email
ilines@freenode.net.

## Add a user

tbd.

## Migration quassel

1. Stop the quassel service
2. sudo -u postgres pg_dump -F c --file=quassel.dump quassel
