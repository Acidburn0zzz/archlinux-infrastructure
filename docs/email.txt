# Adding new archlinux.org email addresses

Login to orion and edit `/etc/postfix/users`, add the new email address in the
appropriate category and run `postmap /etc/postfix/users`.

If the user wants to forward email, either enter the destination directly in
the /etc/postfix/users file or enter a username and then put the destination
into `~username/.forward` so that they can edit it themselves.
